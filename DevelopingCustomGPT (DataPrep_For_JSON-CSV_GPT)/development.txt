  1. Convert text to lowercase.
  2. Remove punctuation and special characters using regular expressions.
  3. Replace numbers with their textual equivalents (optional).
  4. Use stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms.
- **Example Implementation:**
  ```python
  import re
  from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

  def normalize_text(text):
      text = text.lower()
      text = re.sub(r'\W+', ' ', text)
      text = re.sub(r'\d+', '', text)
      lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
      text = " ".join([lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in text.split()])
      return text
  ```

#### 2. Noise Removal
- **Method:** Remove extraneous characters, digits, and text fragments that do not contribute to analysis.

- **Example Implementation:**
  ```python
  def remove_noise(text):
      text = re.sub(r'\W+', ' ', text)  # Remove non-word characters
      text = re.sub(r'\d+', '', text)  # Remove digits
      text = re.sub(r'http\S+', '', text)  # Remove URLs
      return text
  ```

#### 3. Tokenization
- **Method:** Split text into individual tokens (words, phrases).
- **Steps:**
  1. Use libraries like NLTK or SpaCy for tokenization.
  2. Handle specific tokenization requirements based on the domain (e.g., preserving programming syntax).

  imputer = SimpleImputer(missing_values=np.nan, strategy='mean')
  imputer.fit(X[:, 1:3])
  X[:, 1:3] = imputer.transform(X[:, 1:3])
  ```

#### 8. Exporting to JSON or CSV
- **Method:** Convert processed text data into JSON or CSV formats.
- **Steps:**
  1. Use Pandas to structure the data.
  2. Export the DataFrame to the desired format.
- **Example Implementation:**

      return " ".join([stemmer.stem(lemmatizer.lemmatize(word)) for word in text.split()])
  ```

#### 5. Stopword Removal
- **Method**: Remove common words that do not add meaning (e.g., "and", "the").
- **Steps**:
  1. Use predefined lists of stopwords from libraries like NLTK.
  2. Customize the list based on the specific domain.
- **Example Implementation**:
  ```python
  from nltk.corpus import stopwords
  stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
  def remove_stopwords(text):
      return " ".join([word for word in text.split() if word not in stop_words])
  ```

#### 6. Handling Categorical Data
- **Method**: Encode categorical text data into numerical formats using techniques like One-Hot Encoding.
- **Steps**:
  1. Use libraries like Scikit-Learn for encoding.
  2. Apply One-Hot Encoding to categorical columns.
- **Example Implementation**:
  ```python
  from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
  from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
  import numpy as np

  ct = ColumnTransformer(transformers=[('encoder', OneHotEncoder(), [0])], remainder='passthrough')
  X = np.array(ct.fit_transform(X))
  ```

#### 7. Handling Missing Values
- **Method**: Impute missing values using strategies like mean, median, or mode.
- **Steps**:
  1. Identify columns with missing values.
  2. Apply imputation techniques using libraries like Scikit-Learn.
- **Example Implementation**:
  ```python
  from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
  import numpy as np

  imputer = SimpleImputer(missing_values=np.nan, strategy='mean')
  imputer.fit(X[:, 1:3])
  X[:, 1:3] = imputer.transform(X[:, 1:3])
  ```

#### 8. Exporting to JSON or CSV
- **Method**: Convert processed text data into JSON or CSV formats.
- **Steps**:
  1. Use Pandas to structure the data.
  2. Export the DataFrame to the desired format.
- **Example Implementation**:
  ```python
  import pandas as pd

  df = pd.DataFrame(data)
  df.to_csv('output.csv', index=False)
  df.to_json('output.json', orient='records')
  ```

### Optimized Prompt for Quantizing Data into JSON and/or CSV Format

You will process the user's raw text to quantize data into JSON and/or CSV data formats. Follow these steps precisely:

#### 1. Normalization
- **Method:** Standardize text by converting it to lowercase, removing punctuation, and transforming numbers.
- **Steps:**
  1. Convert text to lowercase.
  2. Remove punctuation and special characters using regular expressions.
  3. Optionally, replace numbers with their textual equivalents.
  4. Apply stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms.
- **Example Implementation:**
  ```python
  import re
  from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

  def normalize_text(text):
      text = text.lower()
      text = re.sub(r'\W+', ' ', text)
      text = re.sub(r'\d+', '', text)
      lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
      text = " ".join([lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in text.split()])
      return text
  ```

#### 2. Noise Removal
- **Method:** Remove extraneous characters, digits, and text fragments that do not contribute to analysis.
- **Steps:**
  1. Identify and remove unwanted characters and digits.
  2. Remove HTML tags and formatting.
  3. Eliminate domain-specific noise (e.g., "RT" in tweets).
- **Example Implementation:**
  ```python
  def remove_noise(text):
      text = re.sub(r'\W+', ' ', text)  # Remove non-word characters
      text = re.sub(r'\d+', '', text)  # Remove digits
      text = re.sub(r'http\S+', '', text)  # Remove URLs
      return text
  ```

#### 3. Tokenization
- **Method:** Split text into individual tokens (words, phrases).
- **Steps:**
  1. Use libraries like NLTK or SpaCy for tokenization.
  2. Handle specific tokenization requirements based on the domain (e.g., preserving programming syntax).
- **Example Implementation:**
  ```python
  from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
  tokens = word_tokenize(text)
  ```

#### 4. Stemming and Lemmatization
- **Method:** Reduce words to their root forms to standardize variations.
- **Steps:**
  1. Apply stemming algorithms (e.g., Porter Stemmer) for simpler reduction.
  2. Use lemmatization for more accurate reduction based on dictionary forms.
- **Example Implementation:**
  ```python
  from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer, WordNetLemmatizer
  stemmer = PorterStemmer()
  lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
  def stem_and_lemmatize(text):
      return " ".join([stemmer.stem(lemmatizer.lemmatize(word)) for word in text.split()])
  ```

#### 5. Stopword Removal
- **Method:** Remove common words that do not add meaning (e.g., "and", "the").
- **Steps:**
  1. Use predefined lists of stopwords from libraries like NLTK.
  2. Customize the list based on the specific domain.
- **Example Implementation:**
  ```python
  from nltk.corpus import stopwords
  stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
  def remove_stopwords(text):
      return " ".join([word for word in text.split() if word not in stop_words])
  ```

#### 6. Handling Categorical Data
- **Method:** Encode categorical text data into numerical formats using techniques like One-Hot Encoding.
- **Steps:**
  1. Use libraries like Scikit-Learn for encoding.
  2. Apply One-Hot Encoding to categorical columns.
- **Example Implementation:**
  ```python
  from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
  from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
  import numpy as np

  ct = ColumnTransformer(transformers=[('encoder', OneHotEncoder(), [0])], remainder='passthrough')
  X = np.array(ct.fit_transform(X))
  ```

#### 7. Handling Missing Values
- **Method:** Impute missing values using strategies like mean, median, or mode.
- **Steps:**
  1. Identify columns with missing values.
  2. Apply imputation techniques using libraries like Scikit-Learn.
- **Example Implementation:**
  ```python
  from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
  import numpy as np

  imputer = SimpleImputer(missing_values=np.nan, strategy='mean')
  imputer.fit(X[:, 1:3])
  X[:, 1:3] = imputer.transform(X[:, 1:3])
  ```

#### 8. Exporting to JSON or CSV
- **Method:** Convert processed text data into JSON or CSV formats.
- **Steps:**
  1. Use Pandas to structure the data.
  2. Export the DataFrame to the desired format.
- **Example Implementation:**
  ```python
  import pandas as pd

  df = pd.DataFrame(data)
  df.to_csv('output.csv', index=False)
  df.to_json('output.json', orient='records')
  ```
